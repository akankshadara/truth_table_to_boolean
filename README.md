# truth_table_to_boolean
A Prolog program that translates a  truth table to a Boolean formula in canonical form and gives the description of a 2-level circuit using given gates

Implement two versions of the same:

1. The canonical form of the formula is Sum-of-Products form and the 2-level circuit is formed out of AND gates whose inputs may be negated and whose outputs are fed as inputs to OR gates.
 
2. The canonical form of the formula is Product-ofSums and the 2-level circuit is formed out of OR gates whose inputs may be negated and whose outputs are fed as inputs to AND gates.
 
NOTE:
A single output combinational circuit can be represented as a tree where the leaves are labeled by variables and the internal nodes are gates.
